Each difficulty has a prize pool of 3000 PXT. The top 20 easy, top 12 medium, top 8 hard and top 4 hell groups are rewarded with this formula per player: * (<bosskills of group) / ) / 8

Example:

Top 20 easy groups have a total of 10.000 bosskills. Top 1 group has 1600 kills:
3000 * (1600/ 10000) / 8 = 60 So each player of top 1 group gets 60 PXT ins this example.
